# Data Visualisation task:India (1960–2024) - SkillCraft Technology Internship

📌 Project Overview

This project performs Data Visualisation on population data obtained from the World Bank Open Data platform.
It visualizes population data using bar charts and time-series area charts to understand both cross-sectional and temporal patterns.

The analysis includes:

Comparison of population across countries

Detailed population growth analysis of India over time

Phase-wise interpretation of India’s population growth

📁 Dataset Information

Source: World Bank Open Data

Indicator: Total Population (SP.POP.TOTL)

Time Period: 1960 – 2024

Geographic Scope: Global (India highlighted)

🧪 Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – data manipulation and cleaning

Matplotlib – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – interactive analysis

📊 Visualizations Included
1️⃣ Bar Chart – Top 10 Most Populated Countries

X-axis: Country

Y-axis: Population

Purpose:

Compare population sizes across countries

Identify the most populous countries globally

This visualization provides a categorical comparison of population values.

2️⃣ Area Chart – Population Growth of India (1960–2024)

X-axis: Year

Y-axis: Population

Plot Type: Line plot with filled area

Purpose:

Visualize long-term population growth

Emphasize cumulative increase over time

Growth Phases Highlighted
Phase	Years	Description
Phase 1	1960–1980	Early growth phase
Phase 2	1981–2000	Rapid growth phase
Phase 3	2001–2024	Modern growth phase

Each phase is visually separated using filled regions under the population curve.

🎯 Key Insights

India is among the most populous countries in the world

Population growth shows a steady upward trend

Growth accelerates after 1980

Area charts are effective for representing long-term cumulative data

Bar charts are effective for country-level comparisons

✅ Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates:

Use of a reliable real-world dataset

Appropriate visualization selection

Clear interpretation of population trends

Phase-wise demographic analysis

The project adheres to academic standards and is suitable for coursework, evaluation, or portfolio use.
